`@near-eth/aurora-ether`
========================

A Connector Library for sending Ether(ETH) over the Rainbow Bridge to and from Aurora Network.

This is a Connector Library that integrates with [@near-eth/client]. For detailed instructions on how to use it, see the README there.

This package makes it easy for your app (or, someday, CLI) to send *ETH* over the Rainbow Bridge, using the [Eth Connector contracts](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/eth-connector/).
