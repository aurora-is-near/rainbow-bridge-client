`@near-eth/aurora-erc20`
========================

A Connector Library for sending Fungible Tokens over the Rainbow Bridge to and from Aurora Network.

This is a Connector Library that integrates with [@near-eth/client]. For detailed instructions on how to use it, see the README there.

This package makes it easy for your app (or, someday, CLI) to send *Fungible Tokens* over the Rainbow Bridge, using the [Fungible Token Connector contracts](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector). It lets you send [ERC20] Tokens (Ethereum's Fungible Token standard) over the Rainbow Bridge.
