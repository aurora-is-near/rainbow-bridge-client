`@near-eth/near-ether`
========================

A Connector Library for sending native $NEAR and Ether(ETH) over the Rainbow Bridge.

This is a Connector Library that integrates with [@near-eth/client]. For detailed instructions on how to use it, see the README there.

This package makes it easy for your app (or, someday, CLI) to send $NEAR and Ether(ETH) over the Rainbow Bridge, using the [Connector contracts](https://github.com/near/near-erc20-connector). It lets you send $NEAR Tokens (NEAR's Native Token) over the Rainbow Bridge, where they become [ERC20] Tokens (Ethereum's Fungible Token Standard), and can then be sent back again.
